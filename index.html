            <h2>How to Play: Pig Game</h2>
            <p>The goal of Pig Game is to be the first player to reach 100 points. 
                Players take turns rolling a dice as many times as they like, the score on the dice will be 
                added to their score. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all their points 
                for that turn, then it will move to the opponent's turn. A player can choose 
                to hold their current score and pass the turn to the opponent to save their points. 
                Have fun playing!! ðŸ˜Š</p>
